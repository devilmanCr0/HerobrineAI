### Current Issues ###

Unfortunately, due to the restraints of changed packet protocols in 1.19.3, Herobrine is currently invisible.
Functionalities such as building structures and damaging players still work but the main heart of the plugin is, at large,
unavaliable.
Any help and contributions torwards David's repo is greatly appreciated. Work around Herobrine's visibility is needed.
